A more or less structured bashrc 

Each file has the name of it context, makes easier to keep

the bashrc file will include all files on this directory that has a 
_ in the name. This logic was totally arbitrary. If you want to 
skip the file rename it without _

if you delete your bashrc and run the bashrc it will add a symlink 
to ~/.bashrc pointing to it

We assume that you keep the project inside ~/github
